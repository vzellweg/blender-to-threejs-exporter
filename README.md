# blender-to-threejs-exporter

A Blender plugin to export Geometry Nodes networks to three.js code, including materials and exposed parameters.
This is largely a proof of concept to see if it's possible to export Geometry Nodes networks to three.js code.

## Requirements

- Geometry Synthesis from node network to three.js code
- Material/Texture Synthesis from node network to three.js code
- Parameters exposed in modifier provided in three.js code

## Runbook - COMING SOON

- TODO: developing and building the plugin
- TODO: testing the plugin
- TODO: Using the exported code in a three.js project
- TODO: Examples for demo purposes
